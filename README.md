# Akerman Driving Mobile Robot Modeling and Autonomous Navigation
#### Author : Muhammed Salih AydoÄŸan

In this study, a mobile robot with Akerman driving capability was designed and an algorithm was developed to complete the autonomous navigation task. In addition, the mobile robot was simulated in order to test the developed algorithm.

Autonomous mobility capability will provide multi-directional movement to the mobile robot. In this way, planning, mapping, autonomous driving, service services, product transportation, etc. can be used in areas.

The RRT algorithm has been implamed.
